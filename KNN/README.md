## Overview
This project demonstrates house price prediction using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, based on a dataset sourced from Airbnb. The workflow is divided into three main stages:

1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding as needed.
2. Running KNN with a Randomly Chosen k
Applying KNN for an arbitrary value of k to observe its performance.
3. Iterating Over k Values
Testing the algorithm across a range of k values to identify the optimal k for the best predictive performance.
